This program is separate from different part includes UI, memory, and CPU. We start from build an UI interface by windows builder. Then write function into every component. We can load value from boot.txt to the memory. Through next step we can run the instructions. Memory is made up of an array to store value. Each register shows different value in UI interface. We can also store value to memory by UI interface. We set value for MAR and set value for MBR. It will store index: MAR and value: MBR in memory. We can also use UI to change IX array value to determine effective address.
